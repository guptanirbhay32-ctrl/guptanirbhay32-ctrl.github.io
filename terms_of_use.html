        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <div class="intro">
                <p>The following are the terms and conditions governing the use and provision of services available through the <strong>Inspirion</strong> mobile application (hereinafter the "APP") offered to users worldwide (hereinafter the "USERS").</p>
                
                <p>These services consist of providing USERS with access to daily inspirational quotes, motivational content, and related features (hereinafter the "SERVICES") through the mobile application in exchange for consideration given by USERS.</p>
                
                <p>Access to or use of the APP by the USER, as well as the contracting of the services offered in the APP, necessarily implies, without reservation, that the USER:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Has read, understood and accepted these TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</li>
                    <li>Is a person with sufficient capacity to enter into contracts.</li>
                    <li>Assumes all obligations and accepts these conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="contact-info">
                <p><strong>Owner:</strong> Inspirion</p>
                <p><strong>Contact:</strong> guptanirbhay897@gmail.com</p>
            </div>

            <p>Therefore, before using and/or contracting the SERVICES, it is recommended that you carefully read these TERMS AND CONDITIONS and, if in doubt, you can raise any questions via email at guptanirbhay897@gmail.com.</p>

            <p>These TERMS AND CONDITIONS shall remain in force for an indefinite period while the contracted services are used and shall apply to all contracts for the SERVICES.</p>

            <p>The SERVICES are constantly being improved; therefore, these TERMS AND CONDITIONS may be modified and updated, and will be published and duly notified to USERS, who may accept the modifications and/or reject them by cancelling the contracted SERVICES, where applicable.</p>

            <h2>1. CONTRACTING THE SERVICES</h2>
            <p>The contracting of the SERVICES offered shall only be carried out through the APP, and may therefore be carried out by the USER who has downloaded and used the APP available on Google Play Store (Android) (hereinafter "app store").</p>

            <p>The APP is rated for users aged 3+ and may be used by minors. However, the USER declares that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If they are of legal age (18 years or older), they have the legal capacity to enter into contracts through the APP.</li>
                <li>If they are a minor (under 18 years of age), they have obtained explicit permission from their parent or legal guardian to use the APP and contract any paid SERVICES, and their parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these TERMS AND CONDITIONS on their behalf.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>PARENTAL/GUARDIAN CONSENT:</strong> By allowing a minor to subscribe to any paid SERVICES, the parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these TERMS AND CONDITIONS and accepts full responsibility for the minor's use of the APP, including all charges incurred. Parents or legal guardians are responsible for monitoring and supervising their child's use of the APP.
            </div>

            <p>If you detect or become aware that a minor has contracted any of the SERVICES offered in the APP without proper parental or guardian consent, please notify us as soon as possible at the email address guptanirbhay897@gmail.com so that we can take the appropriate measures.</p>

            <h2>2. PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this contract is to regulate the contractual relationship between Inspirion and the USER from the moment the USER accepts them during the online contracting process.</p>

            <p>The contractual relationship entails the delivery and/or access through the APP, in exchange for a specific and publicly stated price, of the following services and content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily inspirational quotes</li>
                <li>Motivational content</li>
                <li>Quote collections and categories</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The SERVICES may be contracted by any natural person after downloading the APP from Google Play Store (Android).</p>

            <p>These conditions shall apply to the USER, as well as the conditions established by the app store and all those relating to consumer protection regulations in the USER's country.</p>

            <h2>3. HOW TO CONTRACT THE SERVICES</h2>
            <p>To contract the SERVICES offered in the APP, the USER must be of legal age and register at the Google Play Store where the APP is available.</p>

            <p>The USER may use the search engine of the app store to find the app and download it to their device. They may also access the download via the following link: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inspirion.motivational.quotes" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inspirion.motivational.quotes</a></p>

            <p>Once the application has been downloaded, when launching it for the first time, the USER may be asked to answer, on an optional basis, some questions related to their preferences.</p>

            <p>All this information can be modified at any time and at the USER's discretion through the corresponding settings panel available in the APP.</p>

            <p>To enjoy all the content of the application, the USER may choose to subscribe to the Premium version through the available payment plans, which may be monthly or annual and may be paid through the various payment options offered by the app store (credit or debit card, UPI, Google Pay, etc.) depending on the device used by the USER.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the USER must read and accept the contract conditions provided by the download platform at the following link:</p>
            <p><a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms/index.html" target="_blank">Google Play Store Terms</a></p>

            <h2>4. PRICES</h2>
            <p>Inspirion will inform the USER prior to contracting the service, through the app store and in the APP itself, of the price of the available SERVICES.</p>

            <p>The prices applicable to each service are those published in the APP and will be expressed in Indian Rupees (₹).</p>

            <div class="price-table">
                <h3>Subscription Plans:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monthly Subscription:</strong> ₹99 per month</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Subscription:</strong> ₹1,188 per year</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The USER accepts that the economic value of the SERVICES may vary in real time without affecting those services already contracted.</p>

            <p>Before making your purchase, you can consult all the details online: services, price, charges, taxes and the total amount of the purchase.</p>

            <h2>5. PAYMENT AND BILLING</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Choice of Service</h3>
            <p>If the USER has opted for paid services, they may choose the rate that best suits their needs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monthly subscription: ₹99 per month</li>
                <li>Annual subscription: ₹1,188 per year</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 Payment Methods and Security</h3>
            <p>The USER can pay for their subscription using any of the options offered by the Google Play Store (credit or debit card, UPI, Google Pay, etc.). Therefore, we do not have access to payment information and, consequently, we do not store it.</p>

            <p>The contract conditions of the payment options offered by Google Play Store are governed by their terms of service.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Applicable Taxes</h3>
            <p>All prices offered are final prices and include applicable taxes. The USER will be duly informed of the total price before contracting.</p>

            <h3>5.4 Price Changes</h3>
            <p>The USER is informed that Inspirion reserves the right to modify prices at any time.</p>

            <p>When purchasing a subscription, you will initially be charged the rate in force at the time of subscription. If the subscription price increases at a later date, Inspirion will notify you. This increase will apply to the next payment after notification, provided that at least 15 days' notice has been given.</p>

            <p>If you do not wish to apply the price increase for a subscription, you may cancel it by following the procedure described in section 6. No additional charges will apply, provided that you notify us of the cancellation before the end of the current billing period.</p>

            <h3>5.5 Billing</h3>
            <p>Once payment has been made, the corresponding invoice or proof of purchase will be issued through the Google Play Store.</p>

            <p>The USER may access receipts, purchase history and purchase details in the app store.</p>

            <h2>6. DURATION OF SERVICE AND CANCELLATION</h2>
            <p>The duration of the service will always be for the period selected by the USER (monthly or annual).</p>

            <p>Upon subscription, the USER obtains continuous access to the content of the SERVICES, unless they cancel their subscription. Subscriptions are charged automatically at the beginning of each billing period (monthly or annual). The charge will be made no later than 24 hours before the start of each billing period.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>NO FREE TRIAL:</strong> This subscription does not include any free trial period. You will be charged immediately upon subscribing.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Cancellations:</strong> A subscription may be cancelled at any time during the applicable billing period through the Google Play Store subscription settings. The cancellation will take effect and become effective from the next billing period. For example, if you sign up for a monthly subscription, you may cancel at any time during any month. The cancellation of the subscription will take effect at the end of the then-current billing period.</p>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>NO REFUNDS:</strong> All purchases are final. Inspirion does not offer refunds for any subscription purchases, whether monthly or annual. Once you subscribe and payment is processed, no refunds will be provided under any circumstances. Please carefully consider your purchase before subscribing.
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>SERVICE DISCONTINUATION RISK:</strong> The USER acknowledges and agrees that if the APP is shut down, discontinued, or ceases operations during the USER's active subscription period, no refunds will be provided for any unused portion of the subscription. USERS are subscribing at their own risk and accept full responsibility for this risk. Inspirion shall not be liable for any loss of access to services or any other damages resulting from the discontinuation of the APP.
            </div>

            <h2>7. RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</h2>
            <p>The services provided by Inspirion begin to be performed at the moment the USER makes the payment through the app store and automatically accesses the content of the SERVICES; therefore, it is not possible to exercise the right of withdrawal. In this regard, the USER accepts the above in relation to the right of withdrawal.</p>

            <p>Additionally, as stated above, no refunds are provided for any reason once payment has been processed.</p>

            <h2>8. FORCE MAJEURE</h2>
            <p>The parties shall not be liable for any breach due to force majeure. The performance of the obligation shall be delayed until the force majeure ceases.</p>

            <h2>9. COMPLIANCE OF THE SERVICES</h2>
            <p>All SERVICES offered in the APP are certified and guaranteed.</p>

            <p>The SERVICES offered shall be deemed to comply with these TERMS AND CONDITIONS provided that they meet all the requirements set out below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In accordance with the description provided by Inspirion</li>
                <li>Be suitable for the purposes for which the SERVICES are normally intended</li>
                <li>They are of the usual quality and performance that the USER may expect</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If it is found that the SERVICE does not comply with the established specifications, Inspirion shall, where appropriate, repair or replace the service at no cost to the USER.</p>

            <h2>10. USER OBLIGATIONS</h2>
            <p>USERS must comply with the following obligations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The USER must make proper use of the APP and SERVICES offered by Inspirion without contravening current legislation or harming the rights and interests of third parties.</li>
                <li>The USER must ensure that the data provided when registering in the app store is correct, truthful and accurate, exempting Inspirion from any liability that may arise from errors in the data.</li>
                <li>The USER must be of legal age in their territory of residence.</li>
                <li>The USER is responsible for the use of their USER profile and password to access the app store and must undertake to use them with due diligence.</li>
                <li>Only the contracting USER may use the SERVICES offered by Inspirion and may not make them available to third parties.</li>
                <li>The USER may not misuse the SERVICES offered by Inspirion in any way.</li>
                <li>The USER must use the SERVICES reasonably and in accordance with the intended purpose of the application.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Breach of any of these conditions may result in the immediate withdrawal or cancellation of the SERVICES by Inspirion without the USER being entitled to claim any compensation.</p>

            <h2>11. RESPONSIBILITIES OF INSPIRION</h2>
            <p>Inspirion shall be responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing the service in the manner and according to the characteristics offered through the APP and as established in these TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</li>
                <li>Adopting the appropriate security measures, protecting the confidentiality of its USERS' data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</li>
                <li>In the event of problems arising that are solely and exclusively attributable to Inspirion's systems, Inspirion undertakes to do everything possible to resolve them as efficiently as possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
            <p>By way of example, Inspirion shall not be liable in any case in the event of:</p>

            <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>

            <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.</p>

            <p>Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.</p>

            <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.</p>

            <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
